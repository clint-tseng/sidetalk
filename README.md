Sidetalk
========

Introduction
------------

Sidetalk is a new way to chat with your friends on Google Hangouts (and soon any Jabber service). Instead of a bunch of floating windows, Sidetalk tucks away neatly into the side of your screen. You can always see at a glance who's available to chat with, whether anybody is typing, and any new messages that come in. Check out the full marketing site at [sidetalk.io](http://sidetalk.io).

This app is on the Mac App Store. But I'm leaving the code visible-source here on this repo. What does this mean, exactly? I'm not exactly sure yet. At the very least, it means that all the code I've written is available for anyone to see and learn from. It means that if you have the means and know-how, you can write your own modifications to the software to better suit your needs. But of course it also means that anybody could bypass paying up via the App Store and simply build their own copy â€” or worse, build an unprotected copy and spread it. As long as this repository is open, there's no way for me to physically prevent that, and I'm not the legal recourse type. So if you're reading this and considering stealing it, please just be considerate.

The visible-source repository also means that people could theoretically submit pull requests. I'm not sure how to handle this yet. I haven't yet seen a paid-product open-contribution system that actually works. If you have, please send it along. In the meantime, if anybody does submit a pull request, please note that I have no idea how to compensate you monetarily -- not that I've actually made any money either.

Usage

Please see the in-product getting started guide, or visit the [Sidetalk support site](https://sidetalk.freshdesk.com) for help using the application.

Known issues
------------

Most of what's wrong with the app are what it doesn't already do; that's covered below. Here's what -is- in there that doesn't work so well:

1. I don't think I'm loading everyone's names in the optimal way. I seem to pick up some but not others.
2. If you're scrolled upwards and you are messaged, the resulting notification is still offscreen at the bottom.
3. It's still possible for a notification to overlap with your current conversation if you've typed out more than one line.

What's next
-----------

Here is the list of what I'd love to tackle next. I'd love feedback on what would be most helpful to you.

1. Pinned contacts, so the most important people you always chat with are always at hand.
2. More customization: colors, placements, sizes, etc. What do you most want to customize? A lot is possible.
3. Setting your presence. Right now sidetalk doesn't even set you to available or away or anything like that.
4. Formatted messages. Bold, italics, etc. Probably not colors.

There are many more much, much larger things (stored conversation history; detachable conversation windows; multiple accounts; etc) that I'm also thinking about, but they're too numerous to list here.
